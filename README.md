# college
I created this repo with some of the work I've done in college during my AEC in Production de Médias Interactifs in Cégep Limoilou (College Studies Certificate in interactive medias production). The heavier files (boilerplates) have not been included. The course started in october 2018 and ended in april 2020. My design, conception, animation and short movies can be found on my Behance, don't forget to look it up if you want the big picture of my early work.

### .net_test
This file contains a console application created during my internship as they were trying to teach me .NET. Sadly, I couldn't get all of my exercices to showcase here, but the tic tac toe game is a good example of what kind of clean and readable code I can produce.

### bootstrap&app
Those were my first steps with bootstrap, a brilliant tool for RWD. We've added JSON in the mix to create web apps using a combination of Kloosk Boilerplate with bootstrap librairies in it. The version we used can be found in my other repo.

### html-css
My very first codign steps. HTML and CSS are essentials tools for any front-end developper, as they help with the basic understanding of the web. Here you'll find many examples of my work, from my Hello world to more complicated static pages.

### js
Ahh JavaScript; if HTML and CSS are the backbone of the web, JS is surely the meat. The web is what it is today because of JS. Through our course, we've learned the basics of JS (vanilla) as we moved forward into more complex librairies. The intented goal was to be able to learn how to learn. We then learned a few librairies by ourselves with the help of our teacher so that we could eventually learn it alone.

### json
In this last file, you'll find my first work with AJAX and JSON.
